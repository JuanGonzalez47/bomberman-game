# 💣 Bomberman Clone in C++ & Qt

A classic Bomberman game clone developed in C++ using the Qt framework. This project was created as the final assignment for the "Computer Science II" course to apply and demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), GUI development, and game logic principles.

# 🎯 Project Context and Goals

The primary challenge of this project was to build a fully functional desktop application with an interactive graphical interface. The key learning objectives were:

- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts: Design a cohesive class system to represent every game element (Player, Enemy, Bomb, Wall) using principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Develop an Interactive GUI: Learn to use the Qt framework to manage windows, render 2D graphics, and handle user input (keyboard).
- Implement Game Logic: Build the main game loop, handle collisions, manage game states (start, in-game, game over), and manage real-time events like bomb explosions.
- Utilize a Professional IDE: Gain experience using Qt Creator for project management, compilation, and debugging.

# ✨ Key Features

- Character Movement: Control the player character on a 2D grid-based map.
- Bomb Planting System: The player can place bombs that detonate after a timer, destroying soft walls.
- Destructible & Indestructible Walls: The map contains two types of walls, adding a strategic element to the gameplay.
- Explosion and dead Logic: Explosions propagate in four directions and can trigger other bombs in a chain reaction.
